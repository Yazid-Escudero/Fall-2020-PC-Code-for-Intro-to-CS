//Description:
		This text file contains the pseudocode that pertains to the  CL1_Main.java file. In this pseducocode
		the purpose is to outline  the basic structure of the code that I will implement into a solution that 
		satifies the requirements specified for the lab. I will also include algorithms that I plan to use, and will
		present the logic flow of my code and the program as a whole.
		
		This program will use the "database" that exists in the file "spotifydatabase.txt"
